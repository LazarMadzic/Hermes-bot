### Hermes-bot
# Discord bot for my personal use coded in python.

## It's features are:
# ~play music from Youtube
  +play +pause +stop
  
# ~scrape data from C19 website to get a number of daily cases
  +c19
  
# ~post to Twitter(you need to provide API keys)
  +post text
  
# ~send messages to Whatsapp(you need to scan QR code every time you launch a bot)
  +wa [recipient] text
  
# ~simple TODO tracker
  +todo text +done no. +active

# ~weather report from Weather API(you need to provide API key)
  +weather
  
  
  ## Future plans:
  -Twitter currently doesn't handle messages above character limit, so I'll add "thread" functonality
  
  -receive messages from WA on discord and maybe store contact info because you need to know exact contact number or name
  
  -sending and receiving media such as voice messages/videos/pictures
  
  -add NOTE taking with Google docs
